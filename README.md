This **PowerShell script** is designed to scan a range of IP addresses and ports to check if they are open or closed. It attempts to connect to each port on a given IP address and reports whether the port is open or closed.

**Features**
- Scans an IP address range (default is 127.0.0.1, localhost).
- Scans a specified range of ports.
- Provides output for each port showing whether it's open or closed.
- Set a custom timeout for port connections (500 milliseconds).
